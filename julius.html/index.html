    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part </br>of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>
    <h2>Starting dates
    </h2>
    <ul><li> semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017
       </li><li> semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you </br>could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>
  <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
</p><p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website.
</p>
<h2>Subjects of study
</h2>
<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall </br>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just </br>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued </br>by are as follows, in order of priority:
</p>
<ol><li> H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
   <li> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the </br>audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)
</li><li> HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the </br>research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
</p>
<h2>Exotic dance moves
</h2>
<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, </br>my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance
    </dt>
    <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around </br>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
    </dd>
<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle
</dt>
<dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which </br>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly </br>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired</br> modern styles such as Twerking.
</dd>
<dt>Arctic robot dance
</dt>
<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have </br>discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants </br>of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this </br>because they were really cold.
</dd>
<p>For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.
</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</br>
</p><p>Dr Eleanor Gaye</br>
